# Stanford-CS144-Introduction-to-Computer-Networking

## Why learn this course

The emphasis will be on the basic performance and engineering tradeoffs in the design and implementation of computer networks. To make the issues more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects requiring significant design and implementation. The goal is to learn not only what computer networks are and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they are and how they are likely to evolve in the future. Topics to be covered include: congestion/flow/error control, routing, addressing, naming, multi-casting, switching, internetworking, and network security.
